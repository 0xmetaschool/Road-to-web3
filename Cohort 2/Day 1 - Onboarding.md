# Welcome to Road to Web3!

Hey There, This is  Sneha and Sethu. We are your official guides for Road to Web3

So, you made it to the cohort . Great. Why don't we celebrate it with some good old tweets and posts?

## Kickoff: Let's Get Started

### 1. Connect Your MetaMask Wallet

Let's begin by connecting your MetaMask wallet. On your right, you'll find a quest titled **"Connect MetaMask"** â€” if it's not immediately visible, click on "View all" to see all available quests. This will set up your wallet to mint your proof of completion NFT.

Having trouble? No worries, we've got your back. Check out this course for guidance: [Understanding and Setting up MetaMask](https://metaschool.so/courses/understand-and-setup-metamask-account).

### 2. Follow Our Twitter

Stay in the loop and follow us on Twitter for the latest updates. Look for the quest **"Follow on Twitter"** to the right of your screen. If you can't see it, remember to click "View all".
