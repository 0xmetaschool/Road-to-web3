Before you start writing all that oh-so-sweet code and crafting cool dApps, let's gear up properly.

## Essential Tools Checklist

- **Code Editor**: Grab something like Visual Studio Code.
- **Node.js Magic**: Add some backend prowess to your setup.
- **Web3 Framework**: Consider using Hardhat for your blockchain needs.

Trust us, you need to prep you PC/laptop with all these things in order to take on all the smart contract crunching and dApp Building that you will be doing.
