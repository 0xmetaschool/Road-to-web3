# Second Code Camp: Dive into the World of NFTs!

## Hello Road to Web3 Crew,

It's time for our second code camp, where we're about to jump into the awesome world of NFTs! You're not just going to learn about them; you're going to build and mint your very own NFT. Exciting, right?

## Today's Agenda

### 1. Dive into ERC-721
First up, we're tackling the [ERC-721 token standard](https://metaschool.so/articles/erc-721-tokens/). It's the secret sauce behind unique, one-of-a-kind NFTs.

### 2. Exploring Platforms
Weâ€™ll then explore platforms like Pinata and OpenSea. These are your stages to showcase your NFTs to the world.

### 3. Interactive Course Walk-through
And here's the fun part â€“ an instructor-led session through the course [Write an Elon Musk NFT Smart Contract](https://metaschool.so/courses/how-to-write-a-smart-contract-and-mint-elon-musk-nft-on-opensea?utm_campaign=codecamp2&utm_source=luma&utm_medium=email). You'll learn to write a smart contract and mint your NFT on OpenSea, step-by-step.

## Preparation Checklist

## Challenge Alert! ðŸš€

After the code camp, challenge yourself to create and mint your own unique NFTs. Think of something fun, crazy, or meaningful to you, and bring it to life as an NFT. Share your creations in [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/vbVMUwXWgc) and showcase them on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/0xmetaschool) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/0xmetaschool/). We're eager to see what you create!

Looking forward to an exciting session of learning and creation. Let's make some NFT magic happen!
