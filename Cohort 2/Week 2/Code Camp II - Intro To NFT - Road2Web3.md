# Second Code Camp: Dive into NFTs

## Hello Road to Web3 Crew,

It's time for our second code camp, and we're about to jump into the awesome world of NFTs! In this session, you are not just going to learn about them; you're going to build and mint your very own NFT. Exciting, right?

### ðŸ¤” Whatâ€™s the Plan for Today?

1. **Dive into ERC-721**: First up, we're tackling the ERC-721 token standard. It's the secret sauce behind those unique, one-of-a-kind NFTs.
2. **Getting to Know Platforms**: Weâ€™ll then explore platforms like Pinata and OpenSea. These are your stages to showcase your NFTs to the world.
3. **Interactive Course Walk-through**: And here's the fun part â€“ an instructor-led session through the course [Write an Elon Musk NFT Smart Contract](https://metaschool.so/courses/how-to-write-a-smart-contract-and-mint-elon-musk-nft-on-opensea?utm_campaign=codecamp2&utm_source=luma&utm_medium=email). You'll learn to write a smart contract and mint your NFT on OpenSea, step-by-step.

### âœ… Before We Start:

- **Enroll in the Course**: Make sure to sign up for the [Hello World Contract in Solidity course](https://metaschool.so/courses/writing-your-first-hello-world-contract-in-solidity).
- **Tech Check**: Have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en) and [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) ready for the coding journey.

### ðŸš€ Challenge Alert!

After the code camp, how about you take your skills to the next level? All you have to do is create and mint your own unique NFTs. But here is the catch: You will have to think of something fun, something crazy, or even something that means a lot to you. 

Then bring it to life as an NFT. Share your creations with us on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/vbVMUwXWgc), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/0xmetaschool), and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/0xmetaschool/). We're eager to see what you come up with!
