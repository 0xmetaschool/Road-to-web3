# Devs, Builders and Crypto Bros, Lend Me Your Ears

As you might know, we had our first Ideation Huddle this week and boy, do we have a lot to unpack.

From ideas, teams, and that oh-so-sweet grant‚Ä¶ we covered a lot of topics in our huddle.
And we know that it is quite a tedious task to remember all the nitty-gritty details that were discussed, but don‚Äôt worry, we got you.

This section is sort of like your own personal reminder pad that contains all the rules and guidelines for selecting an idea, forming a team, and increasing your chance of winning that grant.

So, let‚Äôs not waste time and dive into each of those sections.

## Cohort Theme and Ideas

As we kicked off the cohort in January, we want to embrace the theme of new beginnings. This includes new learning experiences, new goals, new buildings, etc. In line with this theme, here are four ideas for you to work on:

- **üèÖ Goal-Setter's Community**: A social media platform that turns personal goal-setting into a community effort. Users commit to their goals by turning them into smart contracts. If they fail, they donate their stakes to charity, creating a blend of social networking and blockchain accountability.

- **üí™ Fitness Challenge Marketplace**: A blockchain-powered fitness ecosystem that uses smart contracts and a cryptocurrency pot to reward fitness challenges, creating a fair and competitive experience in the world of crypto-driven fitness.

- **üìö Learning Pledge Platform**: A decentralized learning platform that uses smart contracts to incentivize the completion of educational goals. The system rewards pledges and encourages individuals to reach their learning targets in a unique way.

- **üéüÔ∏è Blockchain Events App**: A Web3-based event calendar app that uses smart contracts for creating events and managing RSVPs, offering a secure and decentralized solution to event management.

You can base your dApp off of any of these four ideas (or all four, if you are crazy enough), add your own little spin to it and create that super dope dApp that we talked about.

## Team Formation Guidelines

You know what‚Äôs cooler than working on these ideas? Working on these ideas with your dev frens. So, for this cohort, you guys are free to form teams and work together to build an application.

But...but...but, before you start with the team huddles, here are a few pointers to remember:

- **Team Formation and Role Diversity**
    - Teams should **consist of 3-5 members** or individuals **who can work solo.**
    - Teams should **have members with specific roles** such as backend developers, frontend developers, Solidity developers, etc., to cover all areas of development.
- **Communication and Coordination on Discord**
    - Each team must **establish a Discord group** for all communications.
    - Teams are required to post **project updates every alternate day** in their Discord group, ensuring consistent progress tracking.
- **Progress Evaluation and Guidance**
    - **A mentor from Metaschool will be assigned** to each team to provide guidance and oversee progress.
- **Clear Allocation of Responsibilities**
    - **Assign clear roles within the team** to delegate responsibilities.
- **Adaptability and Continuous Improvement**
    - Teams must **accept feedback and be adaptable** to develop their projects successfully.
    - Use an iterative development approach and **regularly improve based on feedback.**

# Project Grant Guidelines

Now that you have an idea and a team, the next thing you need is a means to scale your project once it gets completed. Now, for that, as an initial step, we will be distributing grants worth $5000 to all the awesome projects that get built‚Ä¶

Yup‚Ä¶ you heard it right‚Ä¶. you see, we believe that every project is cool in its own right and we absolutely do not believe in uplifting a few projects and turning our backs on the rest, especially after witnessing all the enthusiasm and energy that you guys are bringing into the community.

So, to celebrate all our builders equally, we won't be picking the top 8 projects (as communicated previously), instead, we will be distributing the grants based on a Quadratic Voting System.

Too many syllables? Let us break it down for you.

‚Üí All eligible projects developed during Road to Web3 - Cohort 2 will be featured on the **Metaschool Build and Showcase** page.

‚Üí We will then invite our amazing community to vote for the projects they deem dope.

‚Üí The grant amount will be distributed based on the number of votes each project receives. In other words, the more unique votes a project gets, the larger the percentage of the grant it will receive.

Now‚Ä¶

‚Üí To vote for a project, a person must be logged into the Metaschool platform and have completed at least one of our courses (skip the [Metamask course](https://metaschool.so/courses/understand-and-setup-metamask-account) please).

Feel free to invite your friends to the platform to support your project.

‚Üí Now that we are implementing Quadratic Voting, it will be much cooler than a simple like/dislike system. With this method of voting, community members can allocate a percentage of their voting power to multiple projects. For example, if a member has a voting power of 100, they can vote for 10 projects by distributing 10% of their voting power to each project. Alternatively, they can vote for just one project by staking all 100% of their voting power on that project. Please note that unique votes hold more value.

‚Üí The voting window will remain open for a specific amount of days and within that timeframe, feel free to shill your projects and get them votes from our community!

‚Üí To avoid any kind of spamming, we will only give voting rights to those members who enrolled in the Metaschool platform 3-7 days before the voting window.

Now, for your projects to be eligible for all this, do keep the following rules in mind:

## üíª Code Management and GitHub Practices

**GitHub for Repositories:** All coding work and related documentation should be maintained in GitHub repositories.

**Regular Code Commits:** Commit code regularly with detailed descriptions, reflecting ongoing progress and facilitating version control.

## üê¶ Public Engagement and Accountability

**Sharing on Social Media**: Team members are encouraged to share their progress, challenges, and learnings on social media platforms. We expect at least 2 posts per week on [X](https://twitter.com/0xmetaschool) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/0xmetaschool/). This promotes accountability and embodies the practice of building in public.

**Individual Contribution Records**: Each update should include a breakdown of individual contributions, highlighting the collaborative efforts of the team.

## üèÅ Final Evaluation and Project Presentation

**Evaluation Criteria**: Projects will be evaluated based on technical merit, innovative application of web3 technologies, and the collaborative effort demonstrated.

**Project Showcase**: At the end of the cohort, teams will present their dApps, emphasizing innovation, functionality, and design.
