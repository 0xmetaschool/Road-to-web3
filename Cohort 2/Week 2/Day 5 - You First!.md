## Reconnect with the World Beyond Screens üåç

We know you've been on a roll, soaking up all that valuable Web3 knowledge, but now it's time to relax and have some fun. Step away from the screens, codes, and the crypto world and spend some quality time with your non-Web3 friends. What do you think? We think they are probably missing you!
