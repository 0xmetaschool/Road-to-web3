# Coding Camp Prerequisites

Before we dive into building and deploying smart contracts, here's what you need:

1. **Basic Understanding of JavaScript**: Most Ethereum libraries and tools are built on JavaScript.
2. **Install Node.js**: JavaScript runtime essential for Ethereum development. [Node.js Installation Guide](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm).
3. **Hardhat Setup**: For creating a local Ethereum network for development without incurring costs. [Hardhat Installation Guide](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/docs/getting-started).
4. **OpenZeppelin Contracts**: Smart contract library for secure and standardized contract development. [OpenZeppelin Installation](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/cli/2.6/getting-started).

Get these prerequisites ready, and you'll be set to start building your very own smart contract!
