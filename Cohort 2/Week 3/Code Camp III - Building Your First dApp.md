## Today's Agenda

### 1. Building a Full dApp
We're kicking off with a full breakdown of building an end-to-end Web3 application. You'll see how all the different parts of a dApp come together to create something awesome.

### 2. Frontend Fun with React
We'll dive into using the React Framework to make a super cool frontend for your dApp. It's not just about the backend; your dApp's gotta look good and be user-friendly too.

### 3. Hands-On Course Action
Get ready for an instructor-led walkthrough of the [Create a Horoscope Web3 NFT Application](https://metaschool.so/courses/create-a-horoscope-web3-nft-application?utm_campaign=codecamp3&utm_source=luma&utm_medium=email) course. Itâ€™s a hands-on experience where you'll be building something really unique.
